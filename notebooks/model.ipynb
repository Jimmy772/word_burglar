      "REVIEWS: {Review: Neocon Nonsense \n",
      " (Full disclosure: I received a free copy of this book for review through Library Thing's Early Reviewer program.) \n",
      " At first glance, journalist Caroline Glick seems well-suited to author a book on the so-called \"global war on terror\", particularly Israel's piece in the puzzle. Born in the United States and educated at Columbia and Harvard Universities, she immigrated to Israel in 1991, where she joined the Israel Defense Force and served as \"a core member of Israel's negotiating team with the Palestinians during the Oslo peace process.\" Subsequently, Ms. Glick also served as assistant foreign policy advisor to PM Binyamin Netanyahu. Currently she is a Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at the Center for Security Policy in Washington, DC., as well as the deputy managing editor of THE JERUSALEM POST (to which she contributes two weekly syndicated columns), and the chief diplomatic correspondent for Israel's MAKOR RISHON newspaper (which publishes a weekly column of Ms. Glick's in Hebrew).* THE SHACKLED WARRIOR: ISRAEL AND THE GLOBAL JIHAD is a collection of Ms. Glick's columns, culled from the pages of THE JERUSALEM POST from 2002 to the present. \n",
      " Unfortunately, Ms. Glick's considerable knowledge and experience is dwarfed by her black-or-white, \"you're either with us or against us\" world perspective. Like most neoconservatives, Ms. Glick has yet to advance beyond Piaget's concrete operational stage of cognitive development. To wit: she seems incapable of anything but dichotomous thinking. \n",
      " For example, take the following passage (from the column \"Politically Correct Perfidy\", dated September 11, 2006). \n",
      " The setup: Harvard University students are protesting a scheduled visit from former Iranian president Muhammad Khatami, who was invited to speak at the school by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. The same week, VP Dick Cheney had to scurry through the back door of the Harvard Club in Boston in order to avoid a few hundred angry protesters. \n",
      " Glick blasts Harvard for extending an invitation to Khatami; doubly so, their failure to schedule a two-person debate rather than an uninterrupted monologue.** She then wonders, \n",
      " \"[H]ad a debate between him [Khatami] and Cheney been organized, it would have been interesting to see which side the protestors outside of the Harvard Club in Boston would have supported.\" \n",
      " Because, ya know, you just can't detest two fascist, murderous regimes simultaneously. \n",
      " Seriously, though, as a self-described liberal/progressive, I think equating Bush/Cheney with the likes of Hitler is misguided hyperbole at best. Even so, I do consider BushCo war criminals, and both the VP and the President ought to be impeached. That doesn't, however, mean that I must automatically support Khatami (along with the likes of Saddam Hussein, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, radical Islamists, suicide bombers, and other assorted bigots who would kill and oppress the Other in order to gain power and/or advance their particular strain of superstition). Again, this \"you're either with us or against us\" dubya speak is the kind of egotistical blather that lost us the hearts and minds of most of the world - allies and \"damsels in distress\" alike. \n",
      " In addition to this black-and-white \"reasoning\", Ms. Glick dons the blinders when it comes to seeing any possible negative consequences on the \"War on Terror\". \n",
      " In the Preface, she writes, \n",
      " \"The forces of jihad - whether comprised of states actors or non-state actors - are the enemy in this war. Consequently, anything that advances jihad's aim of Islamic domination is antithetical to the interests of the free world. Anything that harms that cause advances the interests of human liberty and freedom.\" \n",
      " In two tidy sentences, Ms. Glick has justified torture, indefinite detention, warantless wiretapping, and countless other violations of civil liberties. \"Anything that harms jihad advances the interests of human liberty and freedom.\" The terrorists hate us because we're free - so let's not exercise our freedoms, or the terrorists win! Jonah Goldberg? Is that you? \n",
      " Not to mention, half the Iraqi population is female. Female humans. Female humans who have seen their rights steadily eroded since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But, again true to neocon think, I guess they don't count since they have lady bits and all. \n",
      " Aside from the actual content of the book, I was also dissatisfied with the format. The bulk of the book is columns that have previously appeared in THE JERUSALEM POST. They're arranged by topic into ten chapters, and then chronologically within each chapter. The only new material is the book's preface, meant to introduce the compilation. With no chapter intros to string the individual columns together, the book simply doesn't flow well. Additionally, the columns are presented without context; unless the reader is intimately familiar with everyday happenings in the Middle East, it's sometimes challenging to read the topic as part of a larger narrative. Some background information, where appropriate, would have been much appreciated. \n",
      " All in all, I can sum up my review with one pithy statement: Why buy the book when you can (not) read the neocon nonsense for free? *** \n",
      " * Information gathered from Amazon's THE SHACKLED WARRIOR listing, as well as Wikipedia's entry on \"Caroline Glick\". \n",
      " ** When the current Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was similarly invited to speak at Columbia University on September 24, 2007, this format worked out wonderfully: given the chance to spout off, Ahmadinejad's rants no doubt taught the students in attendance much about the hard-line leader's warped worldview. \"No homosexuals in Iran\"? Indeed. \n",
      " *** Google the individual columns to read them online - or take a shortcut right to TownHall, the epicenter of right wing neocon nonsense. \n",

The oldest son of Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a founding member of Hamas and its most popular leader, young Mosab assisted his father for years in his political activities while being groomed to assume his legacy, politics, status... and power. But everything changed when Mosab turned away from terror and violence, and embraced instead the teachings of another famous Middle East leader, Jesus. In Son of Hamas, Mosab Yousef--now called \"Joseph\"--reveals new information about the world's most dangerous terrorist organization and unveils the truth about his own role, his agonizing separation from family and homeland, the dangerous decision to make his newfound faith public, and his belief that the Christian mandate to \"love your enemies\" is the only way to peace in the Middle East.;\n",

      "Review: Fantastic book. It's good to see both sides of the story from one person who lived both sides. It kept me engrossed all throughout. It reads like a novel despite being offered up as non-fiction. I'm cautious as to how much of this is 100% fact, though I checked many of the sources and researched many of the claims that were fairly easy to verify and that much checked out. I do believe anyone who wants to weigh in on the current events going on in the Middle East should read this as it gives a pretty balanced view of both sides. Yousef speaks of the brutality of both sides of the issue as well as the good sides of both sides. Despite his father being a leader of a terrorist group he also shows that the man did so out of his own personal sense of honor. It will be interesting to see if and what Yousef has to say about current issues. I know he recently appeared on one of the news shows but I didn't see it. If the media outlets are smart they'll put this guy out there to get his opinions and views on what is going on.; Votes: 0; Comments: 0; Rating: 4;}.\n",
