      "Description: The role that won Zakes Mokae a Tony Award brought Danny Glover back to the New York stage for the Roundabout Theatre's revival of this searing coming of age story, considered by many to be Fugard's masterpiece. A white teen who has grown up in the affectionate company of the two black waiters who work in his mother's tea room in Port Elizabeth learns that his viciously racist alcoholic father is on his way home from the hospital. An ensuing rage unwittingly triggers his inevitable passage into the culture of hatred fostered by apartheid.\n",
      "\"One of those depth charge plays [that] has lasting relevance [and] can triumphantly survive any test of time...The story is simple, but the resonance that Fugard brings to it lets it reach beyond the narrative, to touch so many nerves connected to betrayal and guilt. An exhilarating play...It is a triumph of playmaking, and unforgettable.\"-New York Post\n",

      "Review: An enjoyable play, eloquently illustrating racial tensions in apartheid South Africa. Fugard does and excellent job capturing the idea of being on the edge of a long arduous process of mending injustices. I think the ending, in particular, captures well the metaphorical sigh before entering this process. I also find his use of dancing to represent how interactions between the various forces in the world is beautiful. Ballroom dance is something that balances measured actions with ebb and flow and spontaneity. It was a great choice of a metaphor.

      "Review: Possibly the best known of Fugard's plays, and the only one (and the only African play) I've actually seen performed, in Portland about twenty years ago. \n",
      " This is a powerful play about apartheid, and racism in general (it could be reset in the U.S. any time between 1877 and the late 1960's without losing any of its effectiveness); without any scene changes, it takes place in one room in real time, with three characters, a 17 year old white boy named Hally (Master Harold) and two Black servants, Sam and Willie, in their mid-forties (the \"boys\"). The play is particularly strong because the white character is not a conventional \"oppressor\", but a fairly likeable character who seems to have a good personal relation with the two servants -- but we say how the relationship is warped by the dynamics of race and class. \n",
      " Although the ending is ambiguous, or at least unresolved -- as the problems in South Africa were at the time it was written -- and by no means rosy, it seems like a more optimistic play than his earlier ones.

America has bumped into Russia, England is bumping into India, rich man bumps into poor man. Those are big collisions, Hally. They make for a lot of bruises.

      " The play is short and takes place entirely in one simple setting. And yet, the play is fast paced and flavourful.The conversation between characters flows effortlessly, making this play a very easy read. Fugard brilliantly uses ballroom dancing as a metaphor for life, drawing parallels between the power struggles amongst countries and ungrateful couples on the dance floor. As well, he creates a beautiful idea of a harmonic world in the context of a ballroom dancing championship which brings people together to celebrate and to enjoy life. I especially like the simile Fugard proposes of the United Nations being a dancing school for politicians. \n",
      " The play also demonstrates multitudes of conflicting attitudes between the white and the black people during the apartheid in South America. The title of the play itself suggests the uncertain power balance between these two classes of people. The external and internal conflicts all three characters experience throughout this short play are gripping and so full of punch. The end of the play is so compelling, I want to be part of it and shake some sense into one of the characters. Personal growth of the characters is evident in the play as well. \n",
      " I think it's a wonderful short play for young readers and young adults. It's short so it's not intimidating but it covers so many important topics. I would recommend the play to everybody. Myself will definitely add more of Fugard's work to my reading list. \n",

      " 2+ out of 5 stars to Master Harold...and the boys, a play written in 1982 by Athol Fugard. It pains me to give this work only 2 stars as I know the value it truly brings to highlighting apartheid in South Africa when it needed more attention. Perhaps because I read this when I was still fairly young, I couldn't connect with it. As a younger reader, I often struggled with themes around depression, war, slavery and human rights. I couldn't fathom not treating people equally and fairly, and struggled to read the stories. Might be that I didn't want to feel those emotions or I didn't know how to at the time. With this work, the language, the theme and the overall setting was so unfamiliar to me, I thought it wasn't doing justice to the story and the cause. It was meant for an older audience, and probably if I went back to read it now, I'd like it more. It's interesting to think about how you'd change ratings for books and plays as you age, hence why on my blog, I've created the \"what age to read which book by genre\" series... to help ensure books receive the best possible attention when being read. That said, I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this as it wasn't bad; it just fell too flat for me. I suppose the characters were meant to feel like templates... archetypes as opposed to real people suffering... in order to show how this was happening all over in many respects, shapes and forms. In the end, it was work to read it, and when that happens, which is rare, I have to give a lower rating. \n",

      "This type of, often fatal, accident leapt into public knowledge during the Gulf War as if it were an entirely new phenomenon -- yet another example of the problems created, and still far from understood, by the presence of reporters in or near the front line of a battle with the technical equipment to transmit televised coverage of the fighting as it happens.\n",
      "Of course, as Richard Bickers points out in this historical survey of some of the most dramatic incidents of what he more correctly calls 'accidental amicide', it is an occurrence as old as warfare itself.\n",
      "It is inevitable that in the heat of battle men become confused and disoriented and such accidents are bound to happen.\n",
      "Sometimes, as the author shows, the blame can be attributed to the incompetence or stupidity of a commander who leads or sends his men into the line of fire of his own guns.\n",
      "More often, however, it is simply the result of a breakdown in communications, stress or a change in the weather.\n",
      "In this absorbing book, Richard Bickers puts 'Friendly Fire' in its true perspective, using his own experience as an airman in and after the Second World War to show how hard it is for a pilot to distinguish friend from foe.\n",

      "REVIEWS: {Review: I like historical fiction but I admit that I didn't know much about the Crusades until this novel. I soon became immersed in the era because of the vivid, authentic and well-written descriptions. Despite this book being very detailed, it didn't take me that long to read. Once I got into the story, I did not want to stop reading. \n",
      " I liked how the narrative was split to show different perspectives of the conflicts. Plus, I was able to read about several interesting characters. The cast of characters was impressive if at times a tiny bit confusing due to the number and that some went by more than one name but thankfully there was a useful dramatis personae at the front which I could refer back to. \n",
      " All in all, a very good piece of historical fiction. It was clear that Jane Johnson has put a lot of time and research into this and comparisons with Philippa Gregory are justified. I could also see hints of George R R Martin due to the depictions of war that were not sugarcoated. I will definitely be looking at more of this author's work. \n",

      "Description: Serena Staverley was happy at Staverley Court. She loved to roam the stately gardens of her family manor and dream of her future love.\n",
      "But then a cruel fate dealt her a shattering blow. Her father was killed in a duel after losing her hand, her inheritance and her home in a game of cards. All this was now the property of the infamous Lord Justin, Marquis of Vulcan -- a man whose reputation made it unwise for any decent woman to be seen in his company. A strange, cold man whose clifftop mansion echoed with terrible secrets.\n",
      "With her freedom lost on the turn of a card, Serena is bound by a debt of honour to marry. She could run, or she could bow to the will of the brooding stranger who held her father's debt. Either way it meant dishonor -- and the end of her dreams.\n",
      "After her arrival at his ancestral home of Mandrake, she discovers by chance the secrets of his family, and is thrust into a world of smugglers, highwaymen, abduction and murder.;\n",

      "REVIEWS: {Review: Normally I would not read Cartland but I came across some of the plot whilst researching the Regency Era and then saw similarities there that forced me to investigate the book. Before getting it I saw the cheesy film version which is much more readily available in the teens of the 21st century then the book is. \n",
      " Where once Cartland was recognized as a queen of the genre, i do not think she holds up well. We have added more history and attention to the details of the period than Ms. Cartland seemed to have here in this sampling of her style and tale. \n",
      " Where it might be fine for those who like their romances in such a way that there is a hero, a villain, and a heroine, I can't seem to allow Cartland to have a hold on me as either Austen or Heyer does of writers who have left us. Or more modern writers whom give me enjoyment. \n",
      " The tale revolves around the plot line of a woman being lost to our hero over the turn of the play at cards. I think we are assured now in our study of the regency that even were such play to be done, it would be considered debasing against all sides, and that would mean the hero we learn to know in this story, Lord Vulcan, would never engage in such. Or should he try, countless other gentlemen witnessing this would stop them. \n",
      " Cartland, though may not have stopped at such a study of the Regency in order to create her plot and tell her tale. I think that is the disconnect. Suspend my disbelief, but do not force me to think that this is an alternate universe. Thus in the end, I can not recommend this work to others who like the Regency, and since it was difficult enough for me to find, 65 years after it was first published, seeing it fade away from the canon of regencies we read might be better than urging any to find it and read it as well.; Votes: 1; Comments: 0; Rating: 3; \n",
      "Review: It might sound strange but I prefer the background love story between the brother (or the cousin) of the heroine and a lady he has his eyes on, it's much more interesting than the main boring love story between the heroine and the guy she ends up with.; Votes: 1; Comments: 0; Rating: 3; \n",

      "Review: I find about this book, when first I saw movie. And I loved the movie. So, I got the book and love it too. Watched & read many times. \n",
      " Serena lost everything, when her father lost a game of cards. She lost not only her home, but her father and herself. Her father was hooked on gambling and in the moment of weaknes, he pawned his own, only daughter. And then, don't being able to face up, what he done, he shoot himself. Yeah, I'm pissed here too. Put his own daughter on game of cards, lose her and then take an easy way out? Leaving her alone to slurp his shit? What a piece of cowards shit. \n",
      " And the man, who win the house, Serena, is an old pervert, who drooled over her for a long time. But Serena don't wanna have anything to do with him. And maybe some angel was looking after her, because on the same night someone else offered to the old boar, to play cards with him. And that someone is a rake Justin, Marquise of Vulcan. And he wins. \n",
      " Justin wasn't especting, that his new charge is a young beautiful woman. So, he doesn't know what exactly do with her. He takes Serena to his home, Mandrake. Which isn't as it seems at first sight. Mandrake has a lot of secrets. Which Serena slowly finds out one by one. She also finds out that her heart beats much faster, when she is next to Justin. \n",
      " Justin is a cynical and jaded, by greedy women. Which one of them his own mother. What he ever saw, was how she never having enough money. She needs more and more and more. And let me say, she was on my shit list from the moment, when she decided to earn some money on expense of Serena. Which leads to her being abducted by that old boar, when Justins bitch of a mother solds her. You are pissed, right? Because I so wanted to wack the bitch and then kick in the nuts of old boar. But don't worry. Serena had a rescue from unsuspected source. \n",
      " And back to Justin. After spending time with Serena, he starts to see, that she is a rare diamond in a fake high society. And he would be an idiot to letting it go. \n",
      " If you love historical stories, this is a must read. \n",
